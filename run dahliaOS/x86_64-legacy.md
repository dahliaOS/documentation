# Installation 

- dahliaOS supports a wide range of devices. This guide will tell you how to flash it on a USB and what hardware you need.

## Flash the ISO

There are two ISOs to choose from, **EFI** and **Legacy** but this guide focuses on the Legacy ones.


1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/dahlia-os/releases/releases/download/201004-x86_64/dahliaOS-201004-legacy.iso)
2. Download [Etcher (3rd party link)](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and flash the ISO on a USB.
3. You're almost good to go, reboot your system and go in your UEFI and go to the **Boot** tab and select the USB.
4. Your system should boot into dahliaOS!
