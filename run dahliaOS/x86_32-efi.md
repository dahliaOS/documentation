# dahliaOS on x86_32-efi

# Installation 

- dahliaOS supports a wide range of devices. This guide will tell you how to flash it on a USB and what hardware you need.

## Flash the ISO

There are two ISOs to choose from, **linux-builds** and **linux-grub-builds**

- Some devices have a 32 bit UEFI that can boot 64 bit OSes but in order to boot, small changes need to be made on the grub bootloader.

The grub builds have these changes so you just need to download and flash.

- Be aware **linux-grub-builds** are made by [HexaOneOfficial](https://github.com/HexaOneOfficial) and they may break your PC.

They are only made for developers or people who know what they're doing!

### Linux-builds-grub

3. Run Etcher, select your dahlia ISO, then your USB device, then select flash.
