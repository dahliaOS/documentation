# Pangolin Desktop

Pangolin Desktop UI shell, designed for dahliaOS, written in Flutter. As of v200614.1, Pangolin has been available by default as the desktop in dahliaOS Linux-based builds.

### Developing Pangolin for dahliaOS Linux-Based builds

While pre-compiled builds can be found in the dahliaOS-overlays folder, you can also compile Pangolin and include them in the Buildroot toolchain. Pangolin can also be added as a dependency inside of Buildroot via the 'dahliaOS core applications' section under 'Target Packages'

### Prerequisites

To develop for dahliaOS Linux-Based builds, you will need the `Flutter` tool, and a compiled base config from dahliaOS/Buildroot.
Compiling the base config will take about 4 hours. Pangolin will automatically be installed using the x86_64 configuration, but arm64 builds will require a Raspberry Pi 4 with the Flutter tool installed to produce an arm64 Linux-compatible bundle.
