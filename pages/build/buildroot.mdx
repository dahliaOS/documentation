# Build dahliaOS with Buildroot
<Callout>
  Special thanks to [PS4Linux](https://ps4linux.com/build-dahliaos-source/) for
  some of the build instructions and [Advanced Climate Systems](https://acs-buildings.com/) where this project is initially based on.
</Callout>

## Requirements

- Ethernet connection (reccommended for data downloads), a quad-core x86_64 CPU and at least 8 GiB of RAM when compiling.
- 4C/8T or better CPU with 10 GB of RAM for optimal speeds.
- Decent amount of hard drive space, around 64 GB is recommended if you clear out the build directory often.

It takes around 8 hours to build a full image from scratch on a Dell Optiplex 790 with a 3.0 GHz i5-2400 CPU and 16 GB of RAM.

<Steps>

### Get the docker image

1. Download the docker image

```sh
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/dahliaos/buildroot:latest
```

2. Setup Buildroot's volumes

```sh
sudo docker run -i --name buildroot_output ghcr.io/dahliaos/buildroot /bin/echo "Data only."
```

### Building dahliaOS

1. Clone buildroot.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dahliaos/buildroot.git
```

2. Go into the cloned buildroot directory and run `sudo ./build make` or if you want to, you can first make changes to Busybox(init), Linux and Buildroot settings, once you're done just run `sudo ./build make`.

<Callout>
  The build script is used to connect to the docker container and to pass commands to it.
</Callout>
  
- `sudo ./build make busybox-menuconfig`
- `sudo ./build make linux-menuconfig`
- `sudo ./build make menuconfig`

3. Once it's done, your ISO file should be in `/images`!
