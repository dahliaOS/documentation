# Overview of dahliaOS Fuchsia-based builds

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    dahliaOS Fuchsia builds are currently in alpha phase and are not ready to be daily driven!
</Callout>

## TL;DR

You can download the latest dahliaOS Fuchsia build [here](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fuchsia/releases/latest). You may also find the supported hardware matrix [here](https://docs.dahliaos.io/hardware/supported-hardware).

## Running dahliaOS Fuchsia
<Callout>
dahliaOS Fuchsia builds can only run on x86_64 systems with plans to bring ARM64 support later. Also this first build is a stock Fuchsia Workstation installer image, it has not been modified in any way.
</Callout>

### x86_64

- As noted above you can download the latest dahliaOS Fuchsia build [here](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fuchsia/releases/latest).
- After it has been downloaded you can you flash it with any usb flasher like [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) or [rufus](https://rufus.ie).

<Callout>
If you use this image, please let us know how things worked out on your hardware so that we can improve it as we continue.
