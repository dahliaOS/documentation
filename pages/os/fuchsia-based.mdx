# Overview of dahliaOS Fuchsia-based builds

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  dahliaOS Fuchsia-based builds are currently in alpha phase and are not ready
  to be daily driven!
</Callout>

## TL;DR

You can download the latest dahliaOS Fuchsia build [here](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fuchsia/releases/latest). You may also find the supported hardware matrix [here](https://docs.dahliaos.io/hardware/supported-hardware).

## Running dahliaOS Fuchsia

<Callout>
  dahliaOS Fuchsia builds can only run on x86_64 systems with plans to bring
  ARM64 support later. Also this first build is a stock Fuchsia Workstation
  installer image, it has not been modified in any way.
</Callout>

### x86_64

1. Download the latest dahliaOS Fuchsia-based build [here](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fuchsia/releases/latest).
1. After it has been downloaded, flash it with any USB flasher like [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie).

<Callout>
  If you use this build, please let us know how things worked out on your
  hardware so that we can improve it as we continue.
