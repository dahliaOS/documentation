# Packaging Applications for dahliaOS

## Introduction

Packages on dahliaOS make use of the AppImage file format for it's portability and ease of use.

## Prerequisites

To develop packages, you will need the following prerequisites on your host system:

- build-essential
- clang
- ninja-build
- appimagetool

### For graphical applications:

To develop graphical applications, you can use these recommended platforms or choose your own:

- Flutter SDK
- GTK 3/4
- QT

Electron applications are supported but may need to be converted to a more efficient standard in the future.

### Application Structure

Basic application packages need the following files at minimum:

- An `AppRun` file, containing the command used to launch your applications, example below:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
exec $APPDIR/demo
```

- A .desktop file with the parameters of your application, example below:

```toml
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Demo
Exec=demo
Terminal=true
Icon=demo
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
```

- An icon,
- An executable, this is your application itself

### Building an AppImage

Once you have the structure defined above, use:

```sh
ARCH=x86_64 appimagetool MyApplication/
```

to package your application for dahliaOS as an Appimage.

#### For ARM builds:

If your application needs to be built for ARM, use

```sh
ARCH=arm appimagetool MyApplication/
```

to build a 32 bit ARMHF binary.
