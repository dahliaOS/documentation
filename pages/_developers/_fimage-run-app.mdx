# Running a Flutter App on Fuchsia with FImage

This guide assumes you have already configured FImage for Flutter development. If you have not, see [Setting up FImage for Application Development](fimage-app-dev). Flutter should work fine with most apps. If your application uses 3rd-party packages that doesn't support Fuchsia, it might not work.

<Steps>

### Configure FImage Environment Variables

Before you can deploy your Flutter app, you must register FImage's SSH configuration with the Flutter tool.

From inside the FImage directory, run:

```sh
export FUCHSIA_SSH_CONFIG="/path/to/fimage/ssh/ssh_config"
```

If you want the configuration to be persistent, add that command to your shell's init script.

### Add a Manifest to the Application

Head over to your Flutter app's folder. For this example we will be using the [dahliaOS Calculator](https://github.com/dahliaOS/calculator). From the root of your Flutter app, create the folder `fuchsia`, and inside of that, create the folder `meta`. Inside of the newly created `meta` directory, create a file called `calculator.cmx`. You should have created the following directory structure inside of your Flutter app's folder:

```
calculator/fuchsia
└── meta
    └── calculator.cmx
```

Inside of the file `calculator.cmx`, add the following content for a basic Flutter App:

```json
{}
```

  You may need to tweak this to be compatible with more complicated
  applications. See the [Component
  Manifest](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/glossary#component-manifest)
  document on fuchsia.dev for more information.

### Deploy the Application

Now that the application is modified to work with Fuchsia, open another terminal window and start FImage:

```sh
./network-config
```

```sh
./fimage-gui 4096
```

Once the emulator is started and on the home screen, it should show up under `flutter devices`. You can now run the application using the following command:

```sh
flutter run -d fuchsia --verbose
```

The application should compile and launch on the virtual device.
