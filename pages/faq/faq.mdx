# Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)

Questions we get frequently asked.

## What is dahliaOS based on?

At the moment the system is based on Linux and uses Flutter for the desktop environment and applications.

## What about Fuchsia and Zircon?

So far all of the dahliaOS releases are based on Linux meaning that we are yet to release a Fuchsia build but in the meanwhile you can try out our [FImage](https://github.com/dahliaOS/fimage) tool that allows you to emulate Fuchsia.

## Is dahliaOS stable? Can I use it as a daily driver?

No. It's still in development and even though there is the possibility - the user experience does not match our goals.

## How do I install dahliaOS?

At the moment, it is not possible to install dahliaOS.

## Which applications can I run/install on dahliaOS?

Only built-in applications are available while a Wayland compositor that would allow a wider range of applications to be ran/installed is being worked on and in the meanwhile select web applications can be installed using the Web App Manager.
